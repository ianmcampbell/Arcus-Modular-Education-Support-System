# Arcus Modular Education Support System (MESS)

## Designer Sheila Braun, MA; Programmer Ian Campbell, MD PhD. Based on ideas formed at an Arcus Education retreat attended by Joy Payton, MS (who heads up Arcus Education) and Sheila Braun (who teaches R and Statistics as part of Arcus Education)

Many of CHOP’s principle investigators and their teams have become interested in R and statistical analysis in R. In support of the Arcus project at CHOP, Arcus Education’s goal has been to create a learning environment for these topics where 100% of attendees spend 100% of their time working towards their own goals at their own pace. In our workshops (a) each learner sets their own goals; (b) each learner receives an individualized curriculum based on their specific goals; (c) success is measured by the extent to which each learner meets their goals. Workshop attendees have highly variable goals, from R basics to machine learning algorithms for genetic data. We measured the effectiveness of this approach in comparison with a lecture-based curriculum; and we experimented with R packages to answer the question, “How can an instructor who has n attendees at a workshop create n different curricula based on n different sets of learning goals, while still treating the class as n individuals rather than as a single unit?” Our analysis indicates that a lower number of attendees feel dissatisfied with the experience relative to a lecture-based learning experience on the same subject. We used R packages such as shiny and learnr to create a tool that streamlines designing individual curricula. Our interactive poster will not only be a presentation of study data, it will also be a demonstration of our software tool so attendees may create their own curricula based on their own learning goals.



















# Note about this Repo's History

Previously, we had a repository consisting of multiple kinds of files to support our modular education.  We wanted 
to change the structure to 2 or more repositories:  

1. One repository that will hold all and **only** lesson modules (previously the subfolders 
"lessons", "personalized-learning-plan" and "lesson-generator").  We isolate these files so we can clone the entire repo 
to the shiny education server using git (moves us away from subversion) to populate the module list that educators can use 
to create curricula. THIS IS THAT REPO.

3. One repository (or possibly more) that contain(s) the supporting code that actually starts the server and has 
the code that will change seldom.
