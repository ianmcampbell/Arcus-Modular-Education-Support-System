    <h2>Welcome to the <u>A</u>RCUS <u>L</u>earning <u>Ex</u>change (ALEx)</h2>
    Many people at CHOP have become interested in R and statistical analysis in R. For Arcus Education, creating a learning environment where 100% of attendees spend 100% of their time working towards their
    <em>own</em>
    goals at their own pace is of utmost importance. In our workshops, each learner sets their own goals,
    <b>receives an individualized curriculum based on those goals,</b>
    and success is measured by the extent to which each learner meets their goals. Our workshop attendees have highly variable goals and are increasing in number.
    <br>
    <br>
    Below you will find examples of how our system can provide this customized experience while being easily accessible anywhere in the world and maintaining reasonable throughput.
