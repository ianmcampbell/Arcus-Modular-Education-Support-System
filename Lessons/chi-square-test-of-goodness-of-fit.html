<h3>Examples of the Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>

<strong>Example H<sub>A</sub></strong> (2-sided): “The number of times a flipped coin lands on its head <em>is different</em> from 50% of the total number of tosses.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The null hypothesis is usually an extrinsic hypothesis, which means you knew the expected proportions before doing the experiment. Examples include a 1:1 heads to tails ratio or a 1:2:1 ratio in a genetic cross. Another example would be looking at an area of shore that had 59% of the area covered in sand, 28% mud, and 13% rocks; if you were investigating where seagulls like to stand, your null hypothesis would be that 59% of the seagulls were standing on sand, 28% on mud, and 13% on rocks.</p>
<p>Significant results can be reported as “The nominal variable’s category proportions were statistically different from theoretical proportions.”</p>

<h3>Why use it?</h3>
<p>Use a chi-square test to compare a categorical (a.k.a. “nominal”) variable’s category proportions to theoretical proportions. People are usually familiar with them, so if you have enough members in each of your nominal variable’s categories, this test is the best choice.</p>
<p>There are alternatives. Common goodness-of-fit tests are</p>
<ul>
<li>chi-square<br />
</li>
<li>G-test<br />
</li>
<li>binomial or multinomial exact tests</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, there are no assumptions about the distribution of data for these tests. However, the results of chi-square tests and G-tests can be inaccurate if level or cell counts are low. A rule of thumb is that all statistically expected cell counts should be 5 or greater for chi-square and G-tests. If you have fewer than that in any level, use exact tests, which are not bothered by low cell counts.</p>
<p>The advantage of chi-square tests is that your audience may be more familiar with them.</p>
<p>G-tests are also called “likelihood ratio tests” or, by SAS, a “Likelihood Ratio Chi-Square”.</p>

<div id="section-how-it-works" class="section level3">
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>Unlike the <a href="http://www.biostathandbook.com/exactgof.html">exact test of goodness-of-fit</a>, when you do a chi-square test you do not directly calculate the probability of obtaining the observed results or something more extreme. Instead, like almost all statistical tests, the chi-square test has an intermediate step: it uses the data to calculate a test statistic that measures how far the observed data is from the null <em>expectation</em>. You then use a mathematical relationship, in this case the chi-square distribution, to estimate the probability of obtaining that value of the test statistic (i.e., that value for chi squared).</p>
<p>You calculate chi squared by taking the cateogory’s observed count (O for “Observed”), subtracting its theoretical or “expected” count (E), then squaring this difference. The larger the deviation from the null hypothesis, the larger is the difference between observed and expected. You square the differences to make them all positive.</p>
<div data-label="a-2" class="tutorial-question">
<div id="a-2-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="a-2-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="a-2-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
</div>
<p>The next step is to divide each difference by the expected number; then you add up these “standardized differences”.</p>
<p>The test statistic is approximately equal to the log-likelihood ratio used in the G–test. It is conventionally called a “chi-square” statistic, although this is somewhat confusing because it’s just one of many test statistics that follows the theoretical chi-square distribution. The equation is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \chi^{2} = ∑\frac{(O−E)^{2}}{E}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As with most test statistics, the larger the difference between observed and expected, the larger the test statistic becomes.</p>
<p>To give an example, let’s say your null hypothesis is a 3:1 ratio of smooth wings to wrinkled wings in offspring from a bunch of Drosophila crosses. You observe 770 flies with smooth wings and 230 flies with wrinkled wings; the expected values are 750 smooth-winged and 250 wrinkled-winged flies. Entering these numbers into the equation, the chi-square value is 2.13. If you had observed 760 smooth-winged flies and 240 wrinkled-wing flies, which is closer to the null hypothesis, your chi-square value would have been smaller, at 0.53; if you’d observed 800 smooth-winged and 200 wrinkled-wing flies, which is further from the null hypothesis, your chi-square value would have been 13.33.</p>
<div data-label="b" class="tutorial-question">
<div id="b-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="b-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="b-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
</div>
<p>The distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is approximately the same as the theoretical chi-square distribution. This means that once you know the chi-square value and the number of degrees of freedom, you can calculate the probability of getting that value of chi-square using the chi-square distribution. The number of degrees of freedom is the number of categories minus one, so for our example there is one degree of freedom.</p>
<p>The shape of the chi-square distribution depends on the number of degrees of freedom. For an extrinsic null hypothesis (the much more common situation, where you know the proportions predicted by the null hypothesis before collecting the data), the number of degrees of freedom is simply the number of values of the variable, minus one. Thus if you are testing a null hypothesis of a 1:1 flipped coin ratio, there are two possible values (heads and tails), and therefore one degree of freedom. This is because once you know how many of the total are heads (a number which is “free” to vary from 0 to the sample size), the number of tails is determined. If there are three values of the variable (such as red, pink, and white), there are two degrees of freedom, and so on.</p>
<div data-label="c" class="tutorial-question">
<div id="c-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="c-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="c-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
</div>
<p>An intrinsic null hypothesis is one where you estimate one or more parameters <em>from the data</em> in order to get the numbers for your null hypothesis. One example is <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/heredity-and-genetics/v/hardy-weinberg">Hardy-Weinberg proportions</a>, which has to do with, for instance, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/heredity-and-genetics/v/allele-frequency">allele frequency</a>. For an intrinsic null hypothesis, the number of degrees of freedom is calculated by taking the number of values of the variable, subtracting 1 for each parameter estimated from the data, then subtracting 1 more.</p>
<p>Thus for Hardy-Weinberg proportions with two alleles and three genotypes, there are three values of the variable (the three genotypes); you subtract one for the parameter estimated from the data (the allele frequency, p); and then you subtract one more, yielding one degree of freedom. There are other statistical issues involved in testing fit to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, so if you need to do this, see Engels (2009) and the older references he cites.</p>

<h3>Extrinsic Hypothesis for Male Red Crossbills</h3>
<p>European crossbills (<em>Loxia curvirostra</em>) have the tip of the upper bill either right or left of the lower bill. Their crossed bills help them extract seeds from pine cones. Some researchers have hypothesized that frequency-dependent selection would keep the number of right and left-billed birds at a 1:1 ratio. Groth (1992) observed 1752 right-billed and 1895 left-billed crossbills.</p>
<p>Calculate the expected frequency of right-billed birds by multiplying the total sample size (3647) by the expected proportion (0.5) to yield 1823.5. Do the same for left-billed birds. The number of degrees of freedom when an for an extrinsic hypothesis is the number of classes minus one. In this case, there are two classes (right and left), so there is one degree of freedom.</p>

<h3>Extrinsic Hypothesis for Rice Herbicides</h3>
<p>Shivrain et al. (2006) crossed clearfield rice, which are resistant to the herbicide imazethapyr, with red rice, which are susceptible to imazethapyr. They then crossed the hybrid offspring and examined the F2 generation, where they found 772 resistant plants, 1611 moderately resistant plants, and 737 susceptible plants. If resistance is controlled by a single gene with two co-dominant alleles, you would expect a 1:2:1 ratio. Compare the observed numbers with the 1:2:1 ratio using <code>chisq.test</code>.</p>

<h3>Extrinsic Hypothesis for Bird Foraging Behavior</h3>
<p>Mannan and Meslow (1984) studied bird foraging behavior in a forest in Oregon. In a managed forest, 54% of the canopy volume was Douglas fir, 40% was ponderosa pine, 5% was grand fir, and 1% was western larch. They made 156 observations of foraging by red-breasted nuthatches; 70 observations (45% of the total) in Douglas fir, 79 (51%) in ponderosa pine, 3 (2%) in grand fir, and 4 (3%) in western larch. The biological null hypothesis is that the birds forage randomly, without regard to what species of tree they’re in; the statistical null hypothesis is that the proportions of foraging events are equal to the proportions of canopy volume. Set this up and perform a <code>chisq.test</code>.</p>

<p>Notice that the code produced a warning. The expected numbers in this example are pretty small for some groups, so it would be better to analyze it with an exact test. It’s here because it’s a good example of an extrinsic hypothesis that comes from measuring something (canopy volume, in this case) rather than from a mathematical theory. Those sorts of examples can be hard to find.</p>

<div id="section-intrinsic-hypothesis-for-alleles" class="section level3">
<h3>Intrinsic Hypothesis for Alleles</h3>
<p>McDonald (1989) examined variation at the Mpi locus in the amphipod crustacean Platorchestia platensis collected from a single location on Long Island, New York. There were two alleles, Mpi<sup>90</sup> and Mpi<sup>100</sup>, and the genotype frequencies in samples from multiple dates pooled together were 1203 Mpi<sup>90/90</sup>, 2919 Mpi<sup>90/100</sup>, and 1678 Mpi<sup>100/100</sup>. The estimate of the Mpi<sup>90</sup> allele proportion from the data is 5325/11600 = 0.459.</p>
<p>Using the Hardy-Weinberg formula and this estimated allele proportion, the expected genotype proportions are 0.211 Mpi<sup>90/90</sup>, 0.497 Mpi<sup>90/100</sup>, and 0.293 Mpi<sup>100/100</sup>. There are three categories (the three genotypes) and one parameter estimated from the data (the Mpi<sup>90</sup> allele proportion), so there is one degree of freedom.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to run this analysis as you did the others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>observed &lt;- c(1203, 2919, 1678)<br />
expected &lt; c(.211, .497, .293)<br />
chisq.test(observed, expected)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would get these results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pearson’s Chi-squared test<br />
data: observed and expected_prop<br />
X-squared = 6, df = 4, p-value = 0.1991,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which would be wrong.</p>

<p>We can’t use <code>chisq.test</code> because of its faulty assumption about the degrees of freedom. Let’s calculate a variable <code>chi2</code> manually by plugging the correct values into the formula noted above and repeated here for your convenience:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \chi^{2} = ∑\frac{(O−E)^{2}}{E}\)</span>,</p>
<p>where O = observed and E = expected.</p>
<p>It looks complicated, but it isn’t. It’s a fairly simple series of statements in R. You will need 3 variables: <code>observed</code>, a concatenation of the 3 previously mentioned observed counts; <code>expected_prop</code>, a concatenation of the 3 previously mentioned expected proportions, and <code>expected_count</code>, the sum of the observations multiplied by <code>expected_prop</code>.</p>
<p>Have set up those three values, you can now calculate <code>chi2</code> to be the sum of the quantity <code>observed - expected_count</code> (which is what <code>∑(O - E)</code> means), square it, then that quantity divided by the expected count. To get you started, this is the sum of the differences between <code>observed</code> and <code>expected</code> squared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum((observed - expected_count)^2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Divide that by the expected count and you have your <code>chi2</code>.</p>
<p>Try it now, and if you get stuck, peek at the solution by clicking on the Solution button at the top of the code chunk.</p>

<p>The result is not significant. You cannot reject the null hypothesis that the data fit the expected Hardy-Weinberg proportions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Memorize this forever: <em>You haven’t proven the null</em>. You can never prove a null by deciding you can’t with confidence reject it. The bar is very low for proving you can’t reject a null hypothesis. It must be much higher before you can with confidence utterly and forever reject the alternative hypothesis and claim the null hypothesis is true.</p>

<div id="section-graphing-the-results" class="section level2">
<h2>Graphing the Results</h2>
<p>If there are just two values of the nominal variable, you shouldn’t display the result in a graph, as that would be a bar graph with just one bar. Instead, just report the proportion; for example, Groth (1992) found 52.0% left-billed crossbills.</p>
<p>With more than two values of the nominal variable, you should usually present the results of a goodness-of-fit test in a table of observed and expected proportions. If the expected values are obvious (such as 50%) or easily calculated from the data (such as Hardy–Weinberg proportions), you can omit the expected numbers from your table. For a presentation you’ll probably want a graph showing both the observed and expected proportions, to give a visual impression of how far apart they are. You should use a bar graph for the observed proportions; the expected can be shown with a horizontal dashed line, or with bars of a different pattern.</p>
<p>If you want to add error bars to the graph, you should use confidence intervals for a proportion. Note that the confidence intervals will not be symmetrical, and this will be particularly obvious if the proportion is near 0 or 1.</p>
<p>Some people use a “stacked bar graph” to show proportions, especially if there are more than two categories. However, it can make it difficult to compare the sizes of the observed and expected values for the middle categories, since both their tops and bottoms are at different levels, so I don’t recommend it.</p>

<h3>Bar Plot with Confidence Intervals with <code>ggplot2</code></h3>
<p>Now try a bar chart with confidence intervals. You’ll need some code to calculate the confidence intervals. Sometimes factors will need to have the order of their levels specified for <code>ggplot2</code> to put them in the correct order in the plot. Otherwise R will alphabetize them.</p>
<p>I have already loaded the data in <code>forage</code>.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to follow to print the contents of <code>forage</code> to accompany a chi-square goodness-of-fit test:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Specify the order of factor levels (unless you want R to alphabetize them) using <code>dplyr</code><br />
</li>
<li>Calculate the confidence intervals.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following code performs those steps and shows you how <code>forage</code> changes. Experiment with the code if you like, but then copy the solution and run it again to make sure all the values remain as we need them for subsequent code chunks.</p>

<p>Now we plot it. For more information on <code>ggplot2</code> see <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">the documentation at the tidyverse website</a>.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with <code>ggplot2</code> you can build the plot. The data is, of course, <code>forage</code>. For aesthetics (<code>aes</code>), <code>x</code> is the variable <code>Tree</code> and <code>y</code> is <code>Proportion</code> (which we just now created). Use <code>Value</code> for the fill.</p>
<p>The geom we want is <code>geom_bar</code>. In fact we want 2 of them. They both have arguments <code>stat = &quot;identity&quot;</code> and <code>position = &quot;dodge&quot;</code>; the first one has a width of 0.7. The second <code>geom_bar</code> has <code>colour</code> “black”, <code>width</code> 0.7, and <code>show.legend</code> <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>Next add the function <code>scale_y_continues</code>, with breaks at <code>seq(0, 0.60, 0.1),</code>limits<code></code>c(0, 0.60)<code>, and</code>expand<code></code>c(0,0)`.</p>
<p>Next add another function, <code>scale_fill_manual</code>, with arguments <code>name</code> equal to “Count Type”, <code>values</code> equal to <code>c('grey80', 'grey30'), and</code>labels` as the concatenation of “Observed Value” and “Expected Value”.</p>
<p>So much for the basic chart and its bars. Now add the error bars. Use the Solution button to see what the code is for them and for the title, unless you want to figure out it before looking at my code. Well, not my code. It is adapted from the <a href="http://shinyapps.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/">R Graph Catalogue</a>, which you might want to explore.</p>
